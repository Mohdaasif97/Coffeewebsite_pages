# â˜• Coffee Budapest - Website

**Live Demo:** [https://mohdaasif97.github.io/Coffeewebsite_pages/](https://mohdaasif97.github.io/Coffeewebsite_pages/)

A beautifully designed static website showcasing the best coffee shops in Budapest. I created this project to demonstrate modern web design techniques and deployed it using GitHub Pages.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Interactive Filtering** - Filter coffee shops by category (Cozy, Modern, Traditional, Budget)
- **Smooth Animations** - Floating cards, hover effects, and subtle parallax
- **Coffee Shop Reviews** - Detailed reviews with ratings, tags, and pricing
- **Modern UI** - Glassmorphism effects with warm coffee-inspired colors

## ðŸ“± Deployment with GitHub Pages

I deployed this website using GitHub Pages, which makes it super easy to host static websites for free:

1. Created a repository named `Coffeewebsite_pages`
2. Pushed the HTML file to the main branch
3. Enabled GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Selected "Deploy from a branch" â†’ main branch
5. Website automatically deployed to `https://mohdaasif97.github.io/Coffeewebsite_pages/`

GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys whenever I push changes to the main branch - no complex CI/CD setup needed!
